# 332s-chatbot

## Section 1: Overview
This project aims to create a chatbot for answering questions related to CSE 332S: Object-oriented software development. This course is offered at WashU as part of the Computer Science and Engineering department and is a required course for all CS majors and minors. The goal of the project is to give students access to a resource for getting help quickly, even if that help may not be perfect. The chatbot will include:
1. a student facing user interface (likly a web based fron-end)
2. a large language model trained on course resources including past piazza posts, course lecture videos, and course recitation recordings. 
3. a RestAPI that connects the front and back-end, allowing user questions to be submitted

More details with be provided regarding each of the above in section 2.
